import('./bootstarp')
// When the host app loads it will firt load the main.js file.
// At first the remoteEntry needs to be loaded after that the code that runs the host app needs to be loaded.
// This can be achieved in two ways. To asynchornously import the boostrap fil. So that main.js is loaded. After that remoteEntry will be loaded.
// After that the bootstrap is loaded that contains the actual code to run the host app.
// The second option is to add the remoteEntry of the module federated app in the head of host app html file.
